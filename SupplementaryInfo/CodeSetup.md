## Code Setup - Setup and Usage of Jupyter notebooks
To run the code tutorials provided in this book, you will need a Jupyter environment with Python 3.6+. This can be achieved in either of the following ways:

•	Install one on your machine locally via Anaconda Navigator or from scratch with pip. 

•	Use a cloud-based environment such as Google Colaboratory, Kaggle Notebooks, Azure Notebooks, or Amazon Sagemaker.
