# Explainable AI: Foundations and Practical Techniques - Code Repository

Welcome to the official code repository for the book **"Explainable AI: Foundations and Practical Techniques"**.

As the author, I have included all the code examples and practical implementations discussed in the book. This repository is intended to serve as a companion to the book, allowing readers to experiment with the code and gain hands-on experience with the concepts of explainable AI (XAI).
